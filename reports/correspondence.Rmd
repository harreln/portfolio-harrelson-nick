**RL**  D2 presentation notes. 

Make the quantitative variable percent of market, or "market share" 

Perhaps ignoring years and instead have two categories: drought and crop, then the quantitative variable is the percent of market for that crop in that drought condition. 

This entails computing the total annual market value of all crops that year then for a given crop and drought condition, summing the crop value, summing the all-crop values over those years with that droughtcondition, then dividing for a percentage.

**RL**  D1 presentation notes. 

The introduction you gave us verbally is the basis for a written introduction in the report. 

Are the data current? Can you obtain the winemag.com data yourself to bring it up to date?

I'm not sure binning the wine rating into bad and good is the best way to show the data. I wonder if a different graph design (scatter plot?) would better suit the data. 

A possible addition is a horizontal bar chart to the right that shows the N, number of wines by continent. Later in the term I can help you place the graphs side by side. For now you might try creating a separate display of N.

**RL** The links on the README page all work. No problems so far. 

I don't see any data. I would have hoped that by now you would have been examining some data for graphing, even if a graph wasn't ready. I can't emphasize enough how important it is that you work ahead on acquiring data that meets the data requirements for the various displays. This is the single most important obstacle that has kept past students from being as successful as they might have been. 

**NH** Thanks for the feedback. I have been working on the first visualization, however I am still working out of my explore file and haven't moved individual parts into carpentry, design, clean data, etc. These will be available shortly.

**RL** I will use this Rmd file for corresponding with you about your portfolio. Entries will be dated and listed in reverse chronological order--that is, with the most recent at the top of the page. You should record your responses directly below, for example:
