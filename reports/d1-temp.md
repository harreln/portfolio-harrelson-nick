There should be content here. Visualization is a great place to start with R programming, because the payoff is so clear: you get to make elegant and informative plots that help you understand data (Wickham and Grolemund 2017).

Tufte helped brige the gap between how the engineers were thinking about a problem and how they were presenting a problem (Tufte 1997).

Try writing an equation

![
m\\ddot{x} + c\\dot{x} + kx = F

m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = F
")
