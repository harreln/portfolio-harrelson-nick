reflections on rhetoric
-----------------------

**Prompt:** For each of the two authors you select, reflect on their ideas and their messages. What is the most significant idea you can borrow from them that you can apply to your own portfolio? Make your responses as specific as you can.

**Response:** Maps of emotion - Eric Rodenbeck

Eric was attempting to illustrate complex stories within the data he presented. First, with maps relating troop's hometowns and locations of death. This was a somber graphic, that had to convey heavy feelings and memories with respect. Second, he wanted to graphically illustrate immigration trends with an atypical plot, but it worked well nonetheless.

The biggest take away from his talk was how I can emphasize certain data points and make them appear significant. I thought this was shown really well with the plot of immigration to San Francisco, and how certain legislation at the time skewed the census data and showed a graphical anomaly that he could point to.

Simple ideas like this, in combination with considering what story I want the data to tell, will be able to enhance my plots for the viewer's comprehension.

**Response:** Show ideas and evidence - Jonathan Corum

I think Jonathan's ideas are very similar to Eric's but in a different light. When building context around his data sets Jonathan wanted "evidence" that explained what you were seeing, Eric added stories to his data that made it personally relatable. At first Jonathan was discussing how he had to get a thorough understanding of the problem, that wasn't explicity understood just by looking at the data. He had to pull in other resources that he could reference.

I really enjoyed his process of building the final graphic, it was almost artistic. He chose specific elements from the evidence he gather and used it to augment his main data set. He didn't feel obligated to keep the complicated overlapping line plot and instead used the same graphics in context of his own plot. I also appreciated the overall size and apsect ratio of the graphic, keeping in mind your medium when communicating with graphics can help you better tailor it for the reader.
