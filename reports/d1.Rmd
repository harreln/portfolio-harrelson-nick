<center> Display 1: Boxplot of WineMag.com reviews. </center>

The plot above uses data scrapped from WineMag.com, a website that compiles wine reviews made by credible journalists. This dataset was scraped and made available on Kaggle by Zach Thoutt [@KaggleWine]. Personally, I have only been drinking wine for about the last year and although I have started being able to taste some subtle differences between wines I am absolutely clueless when it comes to buying it. Most of my purchases are made from the reccomendations of friends or, for better or worse, guessing and checking. Recently, I expressed this to my friend's father and he sugested I try some South American wines because "you can get some stellar South American blends for only $15." I wanted to be able to confirm this theory as well as make a plot that new wine drinkers could use to generally direct their purchasing choices. 

The dataset contains reviews, 137,221 total, for wines from all over the globe. Initially, the variables included:

* Points - The rating the taster gave the wine from 1-100
* Price per bottle in USD
* Country of origin

The distribution of the points, and the number of countries made it difficult to make a distinct visual argument so I made some simplifications. First, I replaced points with a quality variable. This simply classifies a wine as "Good" or "Bad" depending on its points relative to the median number of points in the dataset. Second, I replaced country of origin with continent of origin. This makes it easier for the user to interpret and is a much easier calculation for the computer to handle ahead of time [@Robbins2013a, 217]. We can now more easily see any general trends as well as allowing us to test the claims of my friend's father. The dataset now contains:

* Quality - Good or Bad
    + Categorical variable with 2 levels
* Price per bottle in USD
    + Continuous quantitative variable
* Continent of origin
    + Categorical variable with 6 levels 

The continents are reordered based on the average wine price within each continent. Placing the most expensive at the top allows the reader to intuitively interpret the plot [@Robbins2013a, 161].

The tick mark intervals were chosen based on what would be relevant for a consumer purchasing wine in the store. Initially, I chose \$5 increments, but this crowded the plot too much for my liking. As a compromise I went with \$10 intervals to keep it relevant, but also to reduce the number of lines and make the data stand out better [@Robbins2013a, 183].

I chose to omit outliers from the plot based on the size of the outliers and the intended audience. The most expensive wine reviewed in the dataset was approximately \$2000, which increased the width of the plot considerably. This made it harder to view the boxes and whiskers accurately, where most of the data and story is located. In addition, this plot is being made for people new to drinking wine. They generally aren't interested in buying the most expensive bottle, let alone a \$2000 one, they want to explore options on a budget. 

Examining the plot, we immediately see how expensive European wines generally are. Strangely, we also see that the cheapest good European wines are actually cheaper than those from Asia, Africe, and Oceania. This may be due to the disparity in quantities of wine from any of these regions, Europe makes much more wine in general so it makes sense there are also more cheap good wines. 

By examining the overlap between good and bad boxplots, we can get an idea of how much you have to spent to more than likely buy a good wine from that region. For example, If we were to buy a \$20 European wine, theres a large chance its not very good since the majority of the bad European wine sits around this price, while only the cheapest 25% of good European wines are available at this price. To get a good European wine you could spend around \$30 where most of the good European wines reside with only the most expensive 25% of bad European wines. Spending \$40 would almost guarantee a good European wine. 

The claims of my friend's father are slightly skewed. A \$15 bottle of South American wine typically is of lesser quality. However, spending closer to \$20 and upwards would almost guarantee a good South American wine. It should be noted that his claims weren't incorrect, there are infact good South American wines available at \$15/bottle but if you were to pick a \$15 South American bottle at random there's a smaller chance of it being "stellar."
