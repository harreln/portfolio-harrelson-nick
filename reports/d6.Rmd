- matrix materials at bottom (but top of strain), makes sense because their purpose is to hold main materials together, not main load bearer
     * most fibers are generally brittle in nature (at least in tension), the    strain from the matrix materials helps support form
     * fibers are too small to secure by other methods, where they get their strength from
- not a surprise, metals at top of density
- benefits of fibers - higher strength, higher modulus, lower density
- depending on whether or not application is strength critical or stiffness critical - look at spec strength or spec mod
