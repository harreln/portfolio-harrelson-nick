Tufte, Edward (1997) The decision to launch the space shuttle Challenger. In: *Visual and statistical thinking: Displays of evidence for making decisions.* Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press, 16--31.

**Prompt:** Tufte says, "Regardless of the indirect cultural causes of the accident, there was a clear proximate cause." Summarize Tufte's explanation of the proximate cause.

**Response:** Those making the launch decision were unable to see a clear link between o-ring failure and cool temperatures. The evidence they required needed proper analysis, as well as proper presentation in order to make a credible argument. The evidence they got however, was in the form of 13 charts poorly made the day of, and presented late at night.

**Prompt:** Describe the evidence the author presents to support those ideas.

**Response:** The first chart describes previous damage to shuttle o-rings but makes no connection to temperatures, the argument of interest. In addition, it has low credability stemming from the hand-written edits and a lack of authorship. There is also no simple metric for the reader to assess damage, instead there are specific o-ring measurements that would only make sense to a person working directly with the o-rings.

**Prompt:** What data were used in making the decision to launch? What data were not used but should have been used (according to Tufte) in making the launch decision?

**Response:** All the data points they had should have been used in constructing these charts, instead they only used a small subset of data points (relating temperature and a subjective decription of damage through SEPARATE charts). This made the results appear inconclusive due to a lack of data. For example, there was o-ring damage seen on the hottest and coldest data points making it seem like the damage occurs regardless. These extremes are also evaluated incorrectly due to the small sample size. In addition data was included from horizontal rocket tests, which do not match the same conditions during launch and are effectively meaningless.

**Prompt:** On page 23, Tufte presents a graph that provides visual evidence that the "launch was completely outside the engineering database accumulated in 24 previous flight." Describe the structure of this data set:

-   Number of observations
-   Data structure: classify each variable as quantitative (continuous or discrete) and categorical (nominal or ordinal and number of levels).

**Response:** 23 observations. Two variables per observation:

-   O-ring damage index, a discrete quantitative variable.
-   Temperature of field joints at launch, a continuous quantitative variable.

**Prompt:** Summarize the main thesis of the paper.

**Response:** There may have been much pressure to launch the challenger, but an effective chart would have easily convinced officials it shouldn't have. Instead, there were poor decisions in presenting the data that obscured it, made it difficult to read, and utilized weak formats. A clear relationship (in this case a comparison) should be shown with the data at the center, allowing readers to effectively interpret the chart without prior knowledge.

Wainer, Howard (2014) Fifteen displays about one thing. In: *Medical illuminations: Using evidence, visualization, and statistical thinking to improve healthcare.* UK: Oxford University Press, 32--49.

Definition: "Gram staining" (named after its inventor, the Danish scientist Hans Christian Gram) is a method of staining to distinguish one type of bacterium from another---it can be used as a faster substitute for culturing. Gram staining is a category with two levels: some bacteria are Gram stain negative and some are Gram stain positive. Read more about it on the
[Gram stain Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_stain).

**Prompt:** Reviewing the article carefully, come up with a list of variables. Classify each as quantitative or categorical, and if categorical, the levels.

**Response:**

variable name: Antibiotic Type

-   type: categorical
-   levels (if categorical): 3

variable name: Bacteria Type

-   type: categorical
-   levels (if categorical): 16

variable name: Minimum Concentration

-   type: quantitative

**Prompt:** The article title is "Fifteen displays about one thing." After reading the entire article, what is the "one thing?" Note that the "one thing" might imply multiple goals or more than one question.

**Response:** The "one thing" is identifying which drug and concentration (or combination of) would be best for treating a specific bateria. A secondary goal would be identifying the best drug for a specific class of bateria (gram positive or negative).

**Prompt:** In your opinion, which of the 15 displays best answers the question(s) about the "one thing?"

**Response:** Figure 2.19

**Prompt:** Explain why.

**Response:** Initially I wanted to say Figure 2.14 answers the question best. You are able to clearly identify which anti-biotics are most effective for one bacteria at a time. However it does a poor job at showing the distinction between positive and negative bacteria and their treatments. At first glance I was hesitant about Figure 2.19 because of its resembelance to Figure 2.17, which can give you a geneal idea but lacks specificity and is hard to read at first glance. However, by grouping the data by gram type, and overlaying the data in only two plots you get a much better idea of how the two classes respond to the anti-biotics in general (the secondary goal as I defined above). It also preserves the usefulness of Figure 2.14 as you are still able to read the docages (not entirely accurate, but just as much as before).

**Prompt:** Re-read Wainer's conclusion section. What main points does he make about graph design or visual rhetoric that you could apply to your own work this term.

**Response:** Using data visualizations for evidence is useless without having a question you want to answer in mind. He references Figure 2.20 which uses the same data but organizes it in a much different way to answer the opposite question of interest (not what drug should treat this bacteria rather what bacteria does this drug treat). You need to think about what you want your plot to show or illustrate and create it around that goal. Otherwise you risk showing something irrelevant and could cloud your argument in the process.
