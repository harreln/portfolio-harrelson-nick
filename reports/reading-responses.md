Tufte, Edward (1997) The decision to launch the space shuttle Challenger. In: *Visual and statistical thinking: Displays of evidence for making decisions.* Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press, 16--31.

**Prompt:** Tufte says, "Regardless of the indirect cultural causes of the accident, there was a clear proximate cause." Summarize Tufte's explanation of the proximate cause.

**Response:** Those making the launch decision were unable to see a clear link between o-ring failure and cool temperatures. The evidence they required needed proper analysis, as well as proper presentation in order to make a credible argument. The evidence they got however, was in the form of 13 charts poorly made the day of, and presented late at night.

**Prompt:** Describe the evidence the author presents to support those ideas.

**Response:** The first chart describes previous damage to shuttle o-rings but makes no connection to temperatures, the argument of interest. In addition, it has low credability stemming from the hand-written edits and a lack of authorship. There is also no simple metric for the reader to assess damage, instead there are specific o-ring measurements that would only make sense to a person working directly with the o-rings.

**Prompt:** What data were used in making the decision to launch? What data were not used but should have been used (according to Tufte) in making the launch decision?

**Response:** All the data points they had should have been used in constructing these charts, instead they only used a small subset of data points (relating temperature and a subjective decription of damage through SEPARATE charts). This made the results appear inconclusive due to a lack of data. For example, there was o-ring damage seen on the hottest and coldest data points making it seem like the damage occurs regardless. These extremes are also evaluated incorrectly due to the small sample size. In addition data was included from horizontal rocket tests, which do not match the same conditions during launch and are effectively meaningless.

**Prompt:** On page 23, Tufte presents a graph that provides visual evidence that the "launch was completely outside the engineering database accumulated in 24 previous flight." Describe the structure of this data set:

-   Number of observations
-   Data structure: classify each variable as quantitative (continuous or discrete) and categorical (nominal or ordinal and number of levels).

**Response:** 23 observations. Two variables per observation:

-   O-ring damage index, a discrete quantitative variable.
-   Temperature of field joints at launch, a continuous quantitative variable.

**Prompt:** Summarize the main thesis of the paper.

**Response:** There may have been much pressure to launch the challenger, but an effective chart would have easily convinced officials it shouldn't have. Instead, there were poor decisions in presenting the data that obscured it, made it difficult to read, and utilized weak formats. A clear relationship (in this case a comparison) should be shown with the data at the center, allowing readers to effectively interpret the chart without prior knowledge.

Wainer, Howard (2014) Fifteen displays about one thing. In: *Medical illuminations: Using evidence, visualization, and statistical thinking to improve healthcare.* UK: Oxford University Press, 32--49.

Definition: "Gram staining" (named after its inventor, the Danish scientist Hans Christian Gram) is a method of staining to distinguish one type of bacterium from another---it can be used as a faster substitute for culturing. Gram staining is a category with two levels: some bacteria are Gram stain negative and some are Gram stain positive. Read more about it on the
[Gram stain Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_stain).

**Prompt:** Reviewing the article carefully, come up with a list of variables. Classify each as quantitative or categorical, and if categorical, the levels.

**Response:**

variable name: Antibiotic Type

-   type: categorical
-   levels (if categorical): 3

variable name: Bacteria Type

-   type: categorical
-   levels (if categorical): 16

variable name: Gram Positive/Negative

-   type: categorical
-   levels (if categorical): 2

variable name: Minimum Concentration

-   type: quantitative

**Prompt:** The article title is "Fifteen displays about one thing." After reading the entire article, what is the "one thing?" Note that the "one thing" might imply multiple goals or more than one question.

**Response:** The "one thing" is identifying which drug and concentration (or combination of) would be best for treating a specific bateria. A secondary goal would be identifying the best drug for a specific class of bateria (gram positive or negative).

As pointed out in class, there may be different objectives for different people. Most of us answered "the scientist's question" with the above, but a doctor/patient would be most interested in treatment in general. For example, gram type is a relatively quick test, while identifying the specific bacteria takes much longer. Knowing what possible treatments you would need based on the limited information could make a difference for a patient.

**Prompt:** In your opinion, which of the 15 displays best answers the question(s) about the "one thing?"

**Response:** Figure 2.19

**Prompt:** Explain why.

**Response:** Initially I wanted to say Figure 2.14 answers the question best. You are able to clearly identify which anti-biotics are most effective for one bacteria at a time. However it does a poor job at showing the distinction between positive and negative bacteria and their treatments. At first glance I was hesitant about Figure 2.19 because of its resembelance to Figure 2.17, which can give you a geneal idea but lacks specificity and is hard to read at first glance. However, by grouping the data by gram type, and overlaying the data in only two plots you get a much better idea of how the two classes respond to the anti-biotics in general (the secondary goal as I defined above). It also preserves the usefulness of Figure 2.14 as you are still able to read the docages (not entirely accurate, but just as much as before).

**Prompt:** Re-read Wainer's conclusion section. What main points does he make about graph design or visual rhetoric that you could apply to your own work this term.

**Response:** Using data visualizations for evidence is useless without having a question you want to answer in mind. He references Figure 2.20 which uses the same data but organizes it in a much different way to answer the opposite question of interest (not what drug should treat this bacteria rather what bacteria does this drug treat). You need to think about what you want your plot to show or illustrate and create it around that goal. Otherwise you risk showing something irrelevant and could cloud your argument in the process.

week 6 reading prompts

Dragga, Sam & Dan Voss (2001) Cruel pies: The inhumanity of technical illustrations. *Technical Communication* 48(3): 265--274.

**Prompt:** Explain how the prevalent treatment of ethics in visual communication is lacking.

**Response:** Most discussions regarding ethics in statistics surround misleading readers, and preventing misrepresentation and deception. However, this article focuses primarily on the ethics surrounding human illness/death data. Too often people are overlooked as just numbers, and the emotional/painful aspects of the story are lost. This can be seen as somewhat disrespectful to those who have suffered. Even if written technical communication has gotten better with this practice as a whole, visual communication has been lacking..

**Prompt:** Explain the purpose of "humanizing" data displays depicting human suffering or death.

**Response:** It reminds the reader that there are actual people behind this data with actual lives. Leaving out this informations lets readers interpret the data almost as if they were looking at lab rat data, completely forgetting the humanizing aspects of it all.

**Prompt:** Consider the authors' attempts at redesigning such data displays. Did one in particular strike you as ineffective? Explain

**Response:** The logger graphic struck me as ineffective. While the cartoon does do its job of reminding people of the type of work entailed, I don't think the cartoon is humanizing enough to relate to. Perhaps an image of a car crushed by a falling tree would be better and more serious. I did like the little box that lists the risks involved, it was succint and did not distract from the rest of the graphic.

**Prompt:** Did one in particular strike you as effective? Explain.

**Response:** I think the baby graphic was incredibly effective because of the thin line it has to traverse. Showing an infant being harmed in any capacity is a big no, but showing the stroller infront of the stairs really helped me understand the risks, the previous graphic didn't give me any understanding as to why strollers had any safety concerns. Including the arrow and ambulance also added a simple cause and effect that wasn't hard to interpret.

reflections on rhetoric: graphical lies
---------------------------------------

-   Describe the author's idea or ideas that you found most memorable.
-   Discuss how you will apply the idea(s) to one of your designs

**Reading:** How to display data badly (Wainer, 2000)

**Response:** I think a lot of this goes into understanding your data well, and your motivations behind displaying the data. Choosing to emphasize and deemphasize specific elements can hide some details while misproportioning the importance of others.

**Video:** [How charts lie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd046xZhO_8&t=21m29s) by Alberto Cairo

**Response:** The map data for violent crime in london was memorable to me because I've made this exact mistake in some of my previous work without realizing it. Of course it makes sense for crime to occur where theres more people. By actually normalizing the data with population, you can see where the real hotspots and areas of concern are. I think this lesson stuck out the most because at the time, I was really proud of the graphic I made, but this idea invalidates most of it.
