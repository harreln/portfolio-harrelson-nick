Presentation prompts
====================

Complete the prompts before the start of class on the day of the presentation.

-   These points guide the small-group discussions.
-   Much of this work will be part of your portfolio critiques.

D1 distributions
----------------

State the number of observations: 137,221

List the variables:

-   Quality - Good or Bad
    -   Categorical variable with 2 levels
-   Continent of origin
    -   Categorical variable with 6 levels
-   Price per bottle in USD
    -   Continuous quantitative variable

State the graph type: Boxplot

Explain why the graph type is suited to the data structure:

-   The large number of observations makes it impossible to see any distinct argument when using a strip plot.
-   The outliers aren't that useful in this case, so we want to get an idea of where the majority of the data lives.
-   There is a single quantitative variable that we want to compare between categories.

Explain each design choice and cite its supporting reference

-   Distinguished good/bad wine based on the median of the points in the dataset. This makes it easier for the user to interpret and is a much easier calculation for the computer to handle ahead of time (Robbins, 2013a, 217). The same can be argued for simplifying country to continent.
-   Reordered the data based on the average price within each continent. Allows the reader to better understand the data (Robbins, 2013a, 161).
-   Chose tick mark intervals of $10. I originally chose $5 because I thought that would be most relevant to the consumer, but I thought this cluttered the graph too much. As a compromise I went with $10 intervals to keep it relevant, but also to reduce the number of lines and make the data stand out better (Robbins, 2013a, 183).
-   Flipped the axes so that the continent labels can be more easily read.
-   Chose not to display outliers, as they are so large that they change the size of the boxplots relative to the data rectangle making them hard to read/distinguish.

Comments from peers

-   vertical lines for comparisons at dollar amounts
-   inflation on prices (years)
-   stuff for class, introduction, then plot, then choices
-   where the division is between good/bad may vary

D2 multiway
-----------

State the number of observations: 177

List the variables:

-   Market value (USD billions)
    -   continuous quantitative variable
-   Commodity
    -   nominal categorical with 24 levels
-   Year
    -   ordinal categorical with 8 levels
-   Drought Intensity
    -   ordinal catergorical with 6 levels

State the graph type: multiway plot

Explain why the graph type is suited to the data structure:

There is enough overlap between the years and commoditities for a multiway plot. The commodities that fell out of the top 20 are simply not listed for those years. This plot helps explain the trends within each commodity while still allowing you to get a picture of the overall market.

Explain each design choice and cite its supporting reference

-   Reordered the commodities based on median market value. Allows the reader to better understand the data (Robbins, 2013a, 161).
-   Made commodity the facet to organize by, I think it told the more interesting story.
-   Multiway plot prevents superimposed data (Robbins, 2013a, 170).
-   Chose to augment with drought data to add more context.

Comments from peers

Does the data structure satisfy the portfolio display requirements? From the Doumont paper, what type of story is being told? Is the graph type suited to the data structure? Other suggestion etc
