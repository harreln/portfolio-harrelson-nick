Satisfying the requirements for:

-   A multiway plot

Data structure:

-   Market value (USD billions) - determined based on the returns that farmers report.
    -   Continuous quantitative variable
-   Commodity
    -   Nominal categorical with 24 levels
-   Year
    -   Ordinal categorical with 8 levels
-   Drought Intensity
    -   Ordinal catergorical with 6 levels

Introduction
------------

I was interested in seeing how droughts affect the agriculture of a region, specifically California. California is one of the largest producers of food in the United States, producing 13% of total commodities in 2015. The state is also notorious for having primarily been in a drought the last 20 years. This makes it a prime candidate to study how the lack of water affects the agricultural economy.

Findings
--------

-   Largest industries appear more volative to drought. At first I thought it had to do with the type of industry, considering others appear more stable, but then I noticed even the small industries experience some downturn with the drought. Which now makes me think that the shear size of the industry dictates volatility.
-   Pistacho trees are "alternate bearing" meaning they produce heavier crop yields every other year.(<http://fruitandnuteducation.ucdavis.edu/generaltopics/Tree_Growth_Structure/Alternate_Bearing/>)
-   Hay market gets a sudden spike upward in 2011, this may be due to a drought in Texas (another large hay producer) increasing the relative value of the Californian market. As the Texas drought ended, and the California drought began, we see a steady decrease in value. (<https://www.farmprogress.com/alfalfa/alfalfa-hay-growers-told-lower-2012-price-expectations>)
-   Citrus crops make a rise at the start of the drought. Found out that citrus fruits do great in drought due to the cuticle layer in their leaves. This layer makes the leaves thick and shiny, preventing moisture loss via transpiration.

-   Nursery plants and flowers/foliage immediately leave the top 20 as the drought starts. It appears farmers prioritize crops that immediately produce food in times of low water.
